    -   Create a local MySQL instance or install natively in a Docker
    -   Setup two databases. One for dev, one for prod
        -   Call databases as_dev and as_prod
    -   Using the MySQL root user is NOT a good practice
        -   Best practice is to create accounts with the minimum authority required
    -   Create two accounts, one for dev, one for prod
        -   as_dev_user, as_prod_user
    -   Both should have DML (Data Manipulation Language) access (basic CRUD) to their respective databases
    -   Neither should have DDL (Data Definition Language) access

    Request methods, also known as verbs, are used to indicate
    the desired action to be performed

    - GET - is a request for a resource (html file, javascript file, image, etc)
        GET - is used when you visit a website
    - HEAD - is like GET, but only asks for meta information without the body
    - POST - is used to post data to the server.
        Typical use case for POST is to post form data to the server
        (like a checkout form)
    - PUT - is a request for the enclosed entity be stored at the supplied URI.
        If the entity exists, it is expected to be updated.
            - POST is a create request
            - PUT is a create OR update request
    - DELETE - is a request to delete the specified resource
    - TRACE - will echo the received request. Can be used to see
            if request was altered by intermediate servers
    - OPTIONS - Returns the HTTP methods supported by the server for the specified URL
    - CONNECT - Converts the request to a transparent TCP/IP tunnel,
                typically for HTTPS through a unencrypted HTTP proxy
    - PATCH - Applies partial modifications to the specified resource

                Safe Methods

    - Safe Methods are considered safe to use because they only fetch information
        and do not cause changes on the server
    - The Safe Methods are: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, and TRACE

                Idempotent Methods

    - Idempotence - A quality of an action such that repetitions of the action
                    have no further effect on the outcome
    - PUT and DELETE are Idempotent Methods
    - Safe Methods (GET, HEAD, TRACE, OPTIONS) are also Idempotent
    - Being truly Idempotent is not enforced by the protocol

                Non-Idempotent Methods

    - POST is NOT Idempotent
    - Multiple Posts are likely to create multiple resources
    - Ever seen websites asking you to click submit only once?

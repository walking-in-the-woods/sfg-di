                    About Mongo DB

    - MongoDB is a document oriented database
    - MongoDB is a NoSQL database
    - MongoDB documents are stored in BSON (binary JSON)

                    Why Use MongoDB?

    - MongoDB is great for high insert systems
        (Such as sensor readings, social media systems, advertizing systems)
    - Good when you need schema flexibility
    - Can also support a high number of reads per second

                    Why Avoid MongoDB?

    - MongoDB has no concepts of transactions
        - No A.C.I.D.
        - No locking for transactional support, hence faster inserts
    - Not good for concurrent updates
    - Lots of jokes about MongoDB losing data
        (so, it's better to use it on apps like Facebook, (what happen if you lose a "Like"?))

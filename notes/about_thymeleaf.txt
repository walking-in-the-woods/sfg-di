    - Thymeleaf is a Java Template Engine
    - Thymeleaf template engine produces XML, XHTML, and HTML5.
    - Thymeleaf is a replacement for JSPs (Java Server Pages)
    - Thymeleaf is a 'Natural' Template Engine.
    - Is not tied to web environment. (ie can be used for producing HTML for emails)
    - Thymeleaf is not a web framework

                Thymeleaf vs JSP

    - Thymeleaf templates are valid HTML documents you can view in the browser.
        (natural template engine)
    - JSP files are not valid HTML, and look awful in the browser.
    - The natural templating ability allows you to perform rapid development,
      without the need to run a container to parse the template/JSP to view
      the product in a browser.
      - Speeds development time.
        (you can just refresh a browser without restarting the Tomcat)

                Thymeleaf Performance

    - Thymeleaf typically does benchmark slower than other template engines
      such as JSP, Freemaker, and Velocity
        - Note: Spring 5 no longer supports Velosity

    - Thymeleaf 3.0 did bring significant performance improvements
        - Beware of old benchmark data!

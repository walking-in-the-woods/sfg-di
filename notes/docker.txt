    - Docker is a standard for Linux containers.
    - A "Container" is an isolated runtime inside of Linux
    - A "Container" provides a private machine like space under Linux
    - Containers will run under any modern Linux Kernel

                Containers can:

    - Have their own process space
    - Their own network interface
    - "Run" processes as root (inside the container)
    - Have their own disk space
    - (can share with host too)

                A Container is not a VM!

    ---------- Hypervisor -----------             --------- Docker Engine ---------
    ----- Host Operating System -----             -------- Operating System -------
    --------- Infrastructure --------             --------- Infrastructure --------

    The main difference that containers have no guest operating systems.

                Docker Terminology

    - Docker Image - The representation of a Docker Container. Kind of like a JAR or WAR file in Java
    - Docker Container - The standard runtime of Docker. Effectively a deployed and running Docker Image.
                         Like a Spring Boot Executable JAR
    - Docker Engine - The code which manages Docker stuff. Creates and runs Docker Containers

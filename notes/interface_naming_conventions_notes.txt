                    Interface Naming Conventions

    1. Interface should be good object name
       Example Java's "List" interface
          Implementations - ArrayList, LinkedList, CheckedList, SingletonList
    2. Don't Start with "I"
       - NO "IList"

                    Implementation Naming

    - When just one implementation - generally accepted to use <InterfaceName> + Impl
    - When more than one, name should indicate difference of Implementation
